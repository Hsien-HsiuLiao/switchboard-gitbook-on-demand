# Configuration: tweaking configuration

In the previous step we cloned locally the `infra-external` repo, but we're now focusing specifically on this section of the repo:

```bash
infra-external/
│
└── cfg/
    │
    ├── 00-common-vars.cfg
    ├── 00-devnet-vars.cfg
    └── 00-mainnet-vars.cfg

```

Let's focus on one file at a time.
