# Switchboard Feeds

Switchboard data feeds are composed of [Oracle Jobs](https://protos.docs.switchboard.xyz/protos/OracleJob), which define where to source data. Feeds specify a list of different [Task Types](https://protos.docs.switchboard.xyz/protos/Task),  which are used as instructions to fetch data.&#x20;

This section will explore different task types and give an in-depth explanation on how to build oracle jobs.&#x20;
