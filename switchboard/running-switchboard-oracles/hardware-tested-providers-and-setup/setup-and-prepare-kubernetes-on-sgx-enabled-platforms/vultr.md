Product types supporting SGX:

* Bare Metal - Intel E-2388G

### Process  to enable SGX

Using the "View Console" feature in your servers panel, log into the BIOS and ensure that Hyperthreading and overclocking/undervolting are disabled in the bios and SGX is either set to "Enabled" or "Software Controlled"

If you need a more graphical explanation, you can follow step 3 in [this guide](https://docs.vultr.com/custom-iso-on-bare-metal)

### Notes

Sometimes servers with E-2388 go out of stock in a specific region but usually Vultr is pretty efficient in restocking, so keep checking or choose another region nearby.
