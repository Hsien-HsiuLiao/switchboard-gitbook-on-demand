# Quick Start

Switchboard On-Demand is currently supported on Solana and several EVM networks, with more to come! On-demand is designed for maximum speed, security, and simplicity.

See the [Solana Docs](../links-and-technical-documentation/) for tutorials on how to get started with pull data in Solana programs and using the Switchboard TypeScript SDK to update feeds.

See the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Docs](../switchboard-on-evm/) for a tutorial on using Switchboard feeds in Solidity and getting update data with our Oracle APIs.
