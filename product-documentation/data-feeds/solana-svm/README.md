Switchboard provides a powerful, decentralised oracle network enabling your Solana and SVM applications to access real-world data. This tutorial walks you through the entire process, from designing a custom data feed to integrating it into your smart contract and frontend.

**Prerequisites**

* Basic understanding of Solana and SVM smart contract development
* Familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript
* Node.js and npm installed

To get started follow [Part 1](part-1-designing-and-simulating-your-feed/) of our guide on designing and simulating your feed.

Alternatively, you can view starter project examples on our [Github](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sb-on-demand-examples/)
