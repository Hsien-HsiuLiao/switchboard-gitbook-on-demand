# SAIL

If you're building decentralised applications that use AI, you've come to the right place!

The rise of autonomous agents is upon us, promising to reshape industries and redefine how we interact with technology. But this rapid innovation faces a critical challenge: **trust**. As autonomous agents become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the question of accountability becomes paramount. We are, in essence, building incredible structures of AI innovation on foundations of, well, hope. Enter **SAIL** – **The Switchboard Attestation Inference Layer** – here to replace hope with verifiable proof.

**The Missing Piece: Provable Autonomy**

Currently, there's a fundamental gap in the AI process. We deploy agents, we task them, but we often lack definitive **proof** that they operated as intended, that transactions were executed correctly, and that workflows followed agreed-upon protocols. This lack of verifiable execution hinders wider adoption, particularly as:

* **Mounting Regulatory and Enterprise Demands:** Both regulators and enterprises are increasingly requiring verifiable trust and accountability from AI agents, moving beyond reliance on assumptions.
* **Decentralised Applications require proof**: _“Trust me bro”_ doesn't fly in DeFi, especially with AI agents running wild. Decentralised apps? They _demand_ proof. If you're sticking AI agents in there, verifiable behaviour isn't a nice-to-have, it's the damn point of being on-chain in the first place.

SAIL provides the critical missing link: **verifiable autonomy, mathematically proven.** It is a system that enables you to confidently answer the essential questions:

* _Was the AI agent operating according to its programmed logic?_
* _Did the transactions executed by the agent follow the smart contract rules?_
* _Can we demonstrably prove the agent completed its tasks as intended?_

**What SAIL Enables:**

SAIL unlocks a new paradigm of accountability and transparency for AI agents, enabling use cases such as:

* **Transparent Transactions:** Cryptographically prove that payments made to an agent followed the exact terms of the smart contract, ensuring financial integrity and auditability.
* **Verified Workflows:** Attest to the successful and correct execution of agent tasks, from content generation to complex operational workflows, providing verifiable proof of service delivery.
* **Enhanced Trust & Compliance:** Build AI-driven applications that meet the growing demands for transparency and accountability, facilitating regulatory compliance and fostering user trust…**or in other words, providing proof your AI ain't gonna rug your users and leave them rekt.**
