# Hardware: SGX tested providers

Throughout our tests, we identified a few trusted and reliable providers that we know are compatible with the set of tools needed in our installation workflow.

In this manual we provide a list of all the providers that we first-hand tested for our Oracle installations.

Our aim is to keep this list up-to-date as more reliable partners and platform will be tested in future so check this manual again in future when you'll want to spin up new ones.

The list below is probably not extensive nor complete, this is just the list of providers we tested to be working.
