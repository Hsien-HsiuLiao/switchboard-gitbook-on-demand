# On Sui

Switchboard On-Demand service allows you to create custom data feeds on the Sui Network with ease and aggregate data from pretty much any source.&#x20;

### Deployments

* Sui Testnet: [0x509b09fb8d4c6bdddbf398fdd4a505386d0bf94560c1a52700820cc78a7e5b86](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0x509b09fb8d4c6bdddbf398fdd4a505386d0bf94560c1a52700820cc78a7e5b86/txs)
* Sui Mainnet: [0x957633c1fd294857390f99dda23524eee7d8bb1671acd7e0c05aaeba38dc98f4](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0x957633c1fd294857390f99dda23524eee7d8bb1671acd7e0c05aaeba38dc98f4/txs)

### Getting Started

Custom data feeds can be configured aggregate data from any oracle ([Switchboard V2](../../switchboard-v2/), Chainlink, Pyth), any REST API, custom on-chain sources (like Uniswap, Raydium, Meteora, Orca, etc), and almost any other data provider.&#x20;

Just like in Switchboard-V2, and On-Demand on Solana, the feed sources can be configured with user-customizable [Oracle Jobs](https://protos.docs.switchboard.xyz/protos/OracleJob).

If you're not sure how to build a feed definition, please see the section on [Switchboard Feeds](../designing-feeds/).

If you want to build feeds quickly in a friendly User-Interface, please try out our [On-Demand Builder](https://ondemand.switchboard.xyz/) (just click 'builder'). It's a drag-n-drop interface with which you can build and deploy feeds.&#x20;

For a quick guide on creating feeds, updating, and reading from them, see [Getting Started](../on-evm-networks/developers-quickstart.md).
