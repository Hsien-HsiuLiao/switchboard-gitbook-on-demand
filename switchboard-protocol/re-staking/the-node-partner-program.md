# The Node Partner Program

Switchboard's Node Consensus Network (NCN) benefits from Jito's robust NCN infrastructure, ensuring strong consensus through numerous independent operators and guaranteeing protocol integrity. Further enhancing security, Switchboard relies on a decentralised network of oracles for vital feed data. Node operators are therefore incentivised to maintain the continuous availability, accuracy, and reliability of this data, strengthening overall network performance.

The Switchboard Node Partner Program directly rewards this crucial contribution, empowering skilled operators to actively enhance the security and reliability of our decentralised oracle network. Program members gain access to exclusive benefits that promote growth and foster contributions to the Switchboard ecosystem:

* **Enhanced Revenue Streams:** Earn Jito NCN staking rewards, Switchboard protocol transaction fees, and additional incentives specifically designed for maintaining optimal uptime and data accuracy within the Switchboard network.
* **Dedicated Technical Support:** Receive direct, prioritised support from the core Switchboard contributors, including access to detailed best practice guides and rapid troubleshooting assistance.
* **Active Governance Role:** Directly shape the future of the Switchboard protocol by actively participating in network proposals, protocol improvement discussions, and community governance initiatives.
* **Exclusive Ecosystem Opportunities:** Unlock collaborative partnerships with leading DeFi protocols, innovative enterprises, and cutting-edge blockchain projects that are actively utilising Switchboard oracle services. You will also be promoted on the Switchboard website and documentation.
