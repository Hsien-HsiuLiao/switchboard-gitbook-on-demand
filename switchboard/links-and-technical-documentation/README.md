# Switchboard on Solana/SVM

Switchboard On-Demand Feeds are engineered for optimal performance, security, and ease of use. This quick-start guide will illustrate the process of utilizing an existing Switchboard On-Demand Feed.

If you're not sure how to build a feed definition, or this is your first time using Switchboard, please see the section on [Switchboard Feeds](../switchboard-feeds/) for a deep-dive on Oracle Jobs.&#x20;

If you want to build feeds quickly in a friendly User-Interface, please try out our [On-Demand Builder](https://ondemand.switchboard.xyz/solana/mainnet/build).&#x20;

For a quick guide on updating feeds and reading from them, see [Developers: Quickstart!](developers-build-and-use.md).

For a comprehensive guide on creating new feeds using TypeScript, refer to: [Creating a Solana Feed](creating-a-solana-feed.md).
