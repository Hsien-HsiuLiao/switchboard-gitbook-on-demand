# Kubernetes Cluster setup guide

While we don't aim at giving a full overview about the entire process, you should be able to follow our instructions as a guideline that is straightforward path to having a working, fully fledged and all-inclusive bare-metal cluster.

All the needed scripts reside in our [https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/infra-external/](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/infra-external/) repo, so start by cloning it locally as it'll be useful soon.
