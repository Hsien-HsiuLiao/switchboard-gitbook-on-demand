# Migrating to Switchboard

Migrating to Switchboard on Solana or EVM Networks is a few-step process.

1. Build a Feed. Building a feed for an existing Chainlink or Pyth feed is a simple process with the Switchboard [Oracle Aggregator](../oracle-aggregator.md).
2. Integrate on-chain. Setup the contracts to read a Switchboard feed on-chain.
3. Add the SDK to the frontend, query data off-chain, and add to endpoints.&#x20;

Get started with each of these in the next sections ([Chainlink](using-chainlink/), [Pyth](using-pyth/)).
