# Quick Start

Switchboard On-Demand is currently supported on Solana and several EVM networks, with more to come! On-demand is designed for maximum speed, security, and simplicity.

* See the[ Architecture Design Docs](architecture-design.md) for more on Switchboard On-Demand.
* See the [Designing Feeds Docs](designing-feeds/) for examples of common Switchboard feeds.
* See the [Solana Docs](links-and-technical-documentation/) for tutorials on how to get started with pull data in Solana programs and using the Switchboard TypeScript SDK to update feeds.
* See the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Docs](on-evm-networks/) for a tutorial on using Switchboard feeds in Solidity and getting encoded updates with our Oracle APIs.
