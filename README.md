# Switchboard On-Demand

Welcome to the Switchboard: **Oracles on-demand** introduction page! In this document, we will review the fundamentals of Switchboard and the unique value proposition of the on-demand oracle.

First, let's decide if this product offering is the right fit for you.  Switchboard on-demand is designed to be a cost optimized, lowest latency, and highest security offering Switchboard offers. Switchboard on-demand oracles exclusively propagate quantitative data, if you wish to securely formulate your own complete transactions on chain, please see [Switchboard Functions](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/functions).

Switchboard On-Demand is built in line to support high fidelity financial systems where users can specify how data from on chain or off chain sources is ingested and transformed.

While many pull-based blockchain oracles manage data consensus via their own L1 and then propagate to users, this causes:

* Increased data staleness before reaching the user
* Oracle operators advantage over the user before the communicated price is actionable.

Switchboard Oracles are run inside confidential runtimes, preventing the oracle from observe the data they are collecting or operations they perform. Hence, the end user has the first look advantage via data propagation.

For your application, if you are in need of highly customizable, highly secure, low latency oracles, Switchboard-On-Demand is the product you are looking for.
