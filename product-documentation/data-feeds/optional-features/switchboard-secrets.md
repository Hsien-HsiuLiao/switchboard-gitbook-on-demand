# Switchboard Secrets

The Switchboard Secrets feature allows you to securely embed sensitive information, such as API keys or private data, directly within your oracle feeds. Leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Switchboard-Secrets ensures your data remains confidential, secure, and easily accessible in milliseconds when needed.

### **Why Use Switchboard Secrets?**

* **Enhanced Security:** Embeds secrets in confidential runtimes, ensuring they are inaccessible to unauthorized entities.
* **Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for separate secret management systems by integrating directly with your oracle feeds.
* **Reliability:** Built on Switchboardâ€™s robust infrastructure, offering dependable and secure data management.

### **Practical Applications**

* **API Key Management:** Securely store and retrieve API keys required for interacting with third-party services with your oracle feeds.
* **Private Data Embedding:** Embed private data that needs to be accessed securely within a decentralised application.
* **Secure Transactions:** Use embedded secrets to authenticate and authorize secure transactions within your smart contracts.
