# Hardware: SGX-Enabled Systems

Throughout our tests, we identified a few trusted and reliable providers that we know are compatible with the set of tools needed in our installation workflow.

In this manual we provide a list of all the providers that we first-hand tested for our Oracle installations.

Our aim is to keep this list up-to-date as more reliable partners and platform will be tested in future so check this manual again in future when you'll want to spin up new ones.&#x20;
