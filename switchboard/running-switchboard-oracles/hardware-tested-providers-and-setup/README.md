# Hardware: tested providers and setup

Switchboard Oracles are designed to provide secure and reliable data within various hardware and provider environments.&#x20;

The successful operation of these systems hinges on compatibility and performance across multiple platforms.&#x20;

This section details the specific hardware and technologies that have been rigorously tested to meet these standards. \
Two key technologies, **AMD SEV** and SGX, form the backbone of the secure computing environments leveraged by Switchboard Oracles.&#x20;

Each provides unique security and performance features essential for diverse deployment scenarios.&#x20;

The following subsections will list the hardware providers and setup that we validated and tested to be working with Switchboard Oracles.
