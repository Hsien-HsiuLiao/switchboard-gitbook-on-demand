# Using Pyth

**About Pyth**

The Pyth oracle protocol delivers high-fidelity, real-time financial market data to smart contracts. It provides first-party data for various assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, commodities, and forex. Pythnet, the blockchain network behind Pyth oracle feeds, sources price updates and bridges them to other chains using the Wormhole protocol.

You can find existing Pythnet feeds at: [https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids)

In this section, we'll cover using Switchboard with Pyth data feeds. See [Migration to Switchboard](../) for a guide on creating a Pyth feed for Switchboard through the oracle aggregator application.&#x20;
