# Brief History and Key Achievements to Date

Launched in 2021, the Switchboard Network rapidly established itself as a leading oracle solution on Solana. Becoming the go-to data provider for such prominent projects as Kamino, Jito, MarginFi, Drift, and others, Switchboard quickly became synonymous with reliable and high-performance data feeds.

Since its inception, Switchboard has evolved into one of the largest and most versatile oracle networks globally. Today, it processes hundreds of millions of data requests weekly, delivering real-time information for over 500 diverse assets across 100+ projects spanning 10+ blockchains, and growing.

Switchboard feeds are renowned for their unparalleled customisability, unmatched speed, and ability to source data from anywhere – whether traditional offchain systems or cutting-edge onchain sources. Significantly outperforming competitors with latency of only 400 milliseconds, Switchboard delivers the **fastest oracle updates available**. In the fast-paced world of decentralised finance, this speed advantage translates directly into enhanced security and reduced financial risk and opportunity to build more efficient dApps for your users.

> _As they say, in gaming, lag can be fatal; in DeFi, data latency can cost you millions._

Don’t just take our word for it, Switchboard is the oracle of choice for many of the largest projects:

> _“Pull-based, on-demand oracles are what will solve a large portion of the congestion on Solana. Currently, everyone is locking and spamming transactions involving the same SOL or USDC oracles. With each protocol having their own cryptographically verified oracle, the hotspot goes away, and everything gets unclogged.”_ — [y2kappa, Founder of Kamino Finance.](https://solanafloor.com/news/switchboard-on-demand-a-potential-game-changer-solution-for-solana-networks-congestion)
