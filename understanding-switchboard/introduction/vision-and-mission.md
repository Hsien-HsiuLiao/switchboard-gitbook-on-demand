# Vision & mission

_Since our launch in April 2021, Switchboard has secured_ [_billions_](https://defillama.com/oracles/Switchboard) _of dollars of on-chain volume, offering high security and low latency guarantees for its data feeds._

_None of the current blockchain oracle offerings can serve as a one-size-fits-all solution. Some prioritize pricing fidelity, others focus on risk management, and some emphasize flexibility. However, time-sensitivity and handling private data are still two big uncovered areas for blockchain oracles._

_Switchboard has been deeply involved in the step-by-step evolution of each of these archetypes. By closely observing market behaviour, we have identified and addressed many persistent pain points in blockchain oracles._

_As such, we looked to start back at the basics and build a new solution built on the principles of:_

* _Offering the highest data security level to the protocol_
* _Offering the cheapest solution to maintain data_
* _Offering the fastest oracle in any blockchain ecosystem_
* _Making the protocol as easy to use as possible_
