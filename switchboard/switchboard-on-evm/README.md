# Switchboard on EVM

We have built some cross-chain bridges and the Switchboard On-Demand service allows users to create custom data feeds on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks.&#x20;

Custom data feeds can be configured aggregate data from any oracle ([Switchboard V2](../switchboard-v2/), Chainlink, Pyth), any REST API, custom on-chain sources (like Uniswap, Raydium, Meteora, Orca, etc), and almost any other data provider.&#x20;

Just like in Switchboard-V2, and On-Demand on Solana, the feed sources can be configured with user-customizable [Oracle Jobs](https://protos.docs.switchboard.xyz/protos/OracleJob).

Switchboard On-Demand Feeds are engineered for optimal performance, security, and ease of use. This quick-start guide will illustrate the process of utilizing an existing Switchboard On-Demand Feed.

## Quick Links about Switchboard EVM

If you're not sure how to build a feed definition, please see the section on [Switchboard Feeds](../switchboard-feeds/).

If you want to build feeds quickly in a friendly User-Interface, please try out our [On-Demand Builder](https://ondemand.switchboard.xyz/) (just click 'builder'). It's a drag-n-drop interface with which you can build and deploy feeds.&#x20;

For a quick guide on creating feeds, updating, and reading from them, see [Getting Started](developers-quickstart.md).
