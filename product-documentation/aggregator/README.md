# Aggregator

Switchboard is the first oracle that aggregates data from multiple oracles into a single transaction. This means that through a single integration with Switchboard, you can harness the power of various oracles, including Pyth and Chainlink, simultaneously and get unified, real-time data to fuel your decentralised applications.

Switchboard platform lets you access multiple oracles in one go, streamlining your data retrieval process. Whether you're a developer, trader, or enthusiast, Switchboard ensures you have the most accurate and diverse data sources available, enhancing the reliability and robustness of your blockchain applications. No more juggling and integrating multiple oracles, as Switchboard simplifies data management, reduces latency, and boosts the reliability of your smart contracts.

Switchboard fetches data from other oracles swiftly and easily through our On-Demand (pull) oracle model. With our unified, efficient, and reliable data aggregation, you can build smarter, stronger dApps with just one simple implementation.

### **Why Oracle Aggregation?**

Imagine relying on a single source for crucial price information. What happens if that source experiences an outage, becomes inaccurate, or, worse, is intentionally manipulated? For decentralised applications, particularly in DeFi, such single points of failure are unacceptable and can lead to severe consequences.

**This is where Oracle Aggregation becomes essential.** Instead of relying on a single oracle, Switchboard's Oracle Aggregator gathers price data from **multiple independent, reputable oracles.** It then intelligently combines this information using sophisticated aggregation methods to deliver a **single, consensus-driven price value** to your smart contracts.

### **The Switchboard Oracle Aggregator**

The Switchboard Oracle Aggregator is designed to be a core strength of our price feed solution, providing:

* **Increased Accuracy:** By aggregating data from numerous sources, the impact of outliers or inaccuracies from individual sources is minimised. This results in a more accurate and representative price reflection.
* **Enhanced Reliability and Uptime:** If one data source becomes unavailable, the aggregator continues to function using the remaining sources, ensuring uninterrupted price feeds for your applications. This dramatically improves resilience and reduces the risk of data outages.
* **Resistance to Manipulation:** Aggregating data across multiple sources makes it significantly more difficult for malicious actors to manipulate the price feed. Attempting to influence the aggregated price would require compromising numerous independent data providers simultaneously, a far more challenging task.
