# Knowledge about Linux and self-hosting

Throughout this manual we assume a good grasp and knowledge of basic networking concepts, Linux system administration and cloud hosting, especially via Kubernetes.

During the installation process all of the following tools will be used, among others:

* Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
* ctr (containerd)
* helm
* kubectl
* git
* ssh
* Kubernetes with k3s or Azure (AKS)
* solana-cli

In order to enable SGX (more on this in the next section) a minimal knowledge about navigating a server/computer motherboard BIOS is also needed.
