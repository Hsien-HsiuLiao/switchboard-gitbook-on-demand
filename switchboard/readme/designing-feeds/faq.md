# FAQ

## Which sources should I pick for my feed?

We generally recommend sourcing data from where an asset is most actively traded / liquidity is greatest for price feeds. This can mean sourcing data from a large centralized exchange versus a small AMM.

Exchanges with low liquidity/volume can become manipulable by bad actors if small enough, so it's up to feed owners to configure their sources and find something that works within their risk parameters.

## How do I get a new Task Type added?

It's recommended to exhaust all options for fetching the data you desire using existing task types before requesting new task types, but if it requires a custom On-Chain SDK, please [reach out ](https://discord.com/invite/switchboardxyz)and it can get added to the roadmap.&#x20;
