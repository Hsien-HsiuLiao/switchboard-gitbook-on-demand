# Data Feeds

If you're building decentralised applications that require timely real-world, up-to-date asset prices on-chain, you've come to the right place!

### **What are Data Feeds, and Why are They Essential?**

Access to reliable, real-world data is essential for smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) to operate effectively, particularly in Decentralised Finance (DeFi). Real-time asset prices, forming the backbone of any DeFi protocol, are among the most critical data points. If you are developing solutions from lending platforms to stablecoins, your application will fundamentally rely on a trustworthy and timely source of price information from an oracle.

This is where **Data Feeds** come in. Think of them as secure bridges connecting the off-chain world of financial markets to your on-chain smart contracts. They provide a continuous stream of verified, aggregated price data for a wide range of assets, enabling your dApp to react to market fluctuations and operate correctly.

### **What are Switchboard Feeds?**

Switchboard is designed to provide **high-performance, robust, and easy-to-integrate Data Feeds** specifically for the demands of modern DeFi and Web3 applications. We understand that in these fast-paced environments, **latency matters**, **reliability is paramount**, and **data accuracy is non-negotiable**. So all Switchboard feeds are built to ensure:

* **Low Latency:** Receive near real-time price updates, critical for reacting to market opportunities and mitigating risk in dynamic markets.
* **High Reliability & Uptime:** Built on decentralised and resilient infrastructure, ensuring consistent data delivery. We aggregate data from multiple reputable sources to enhance accuracy and fault tolerance, minimising single points of failure.
* **Cost-Effective & Efficient:** Optimised for performance and efficiency, aiming to provide value without excessive on-chain costs.
* **Private and Equitable Data:** Switchboard On-Demand operates within confidential runtimes, ensuring that oracle operators cannot see the data they're fetching or manipulate operations. This guarantees that end-users always get the first look at the data, ensuring fairness and a level playing field.
