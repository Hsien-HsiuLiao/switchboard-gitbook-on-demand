# Providing stake to Switchboard

Providing stake to Switchboard is simple!

To start securing the Switchboard network, you may contribute to the Fragmetric vault for stake to be distributed to oracle operators.

To start staking visit the Fragmetric vault page on the Jito Vault website:

[https://www.jito.network/restaking/vaults/HR1ANmDHjaEhknvsTaK48M5xZtbBiwNdXM5NTiWhAb4S](https://www.jito.network/restaking/vaults/HR1ANmDHjaEhknvsTaK48M5xZtbBiwNdXM5NTiWhAb4S/)

From there you can see the:

* Vault Address
* VRT Mint
* Vault Authority
* Vault website: [https://app.fragmetric.xyz/restake/fragsol](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/restake/fragsol/)

Navigate to the Fragmetric application and stake SOL or any of the fragSOL supported LSTs to start delegating to Switchboard oracles and start earning SWTCH

See example at [https://screen.studio/share/MzI1bXNL](https://screen.studio/share/MzI1bXNL)

## What can I stake?

With Jito (re)-staking built in, you can stake any assets your vault supports.

For the Fragmetric Vault, these assets are currently:

* SOL
* JitoSOL
* BNSOL
* mSOL

## How do I earn $SWTCH?

SWTCH is rewarded directly to the vault to be claimable by stakers.

These awards will be distributed every Solana epoch (3 days) and will be viewable on the Fragmetric vault rewards page: [https://app.fragmetric.xyz/rewards/overview/](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/rewards/overview/)

## How much $SWTCH do I earn

The amount to distribute is governed view the Switchboard DAO with the initial year set to distribute 8% of supply to stakers

## How can I unstake?

The unstaking process is controlled by each vault added to the Switchboard NCN.

For the Fragmetric vault, visit [https://app.fragmetric.xyz/unstake](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/unstake/) to initiate the unstake. The unstaking process, like the Solana unstaking process, will take until next epoch to take effect.
