# Running a Switchboard Oracle

All [data feeds](../../product-documentation/data-feeds/) within the Switchboard protocol are sourced from a network of oracles that validate and submit the raw data required to update a data feed. Interested in becoming part of this network by running your own oracle? You're in the right place.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and managing your Oracle on Switchboard. It covers everything from initial configuration to ongoing maintenance.&#x20;
